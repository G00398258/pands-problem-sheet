ReadMe file for my GitHub contents for the Programming and Scripting module.

Contents:
1) bmi.py - this is my attempt at the problem sheet task for Week 2. 
Instructions: "Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py. 
The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. 
The output  is their weight divided by their height in metres squared." 
I made a change to my first attempt in Week 03 where I limited the result to two decimal places, as per the example provided in Moodle.

2) secondstring.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 3. 
Instructions: "Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order." 
I refered to w3schools to get a better understanding of slicing strings, but had to look further afield to find a solution to this problem. 
I found a solution on https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-index-and-slice-strings-in-python-3

3) collatz.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 4. 
Instructions: "Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. 
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. 
Have the program end if the current value is one". 
On my first attempt, I could not figure out another way of printing the value "1" as the last output of the while loop without adding a final line of code that printed out this value. 
After watching the lectures for Week 5, I reattempted this problem using a list method and felt this worked better for this problem.

4) weekday.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 5. 
Instructions: "Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday". 
I checked w3schools for help with this problem but needed more examples. 
I found a solution on https://intellipaat.com/community/5576/how-do-i-get-the-day-of-week-given-a-date-in-python

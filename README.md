Contents:
1) bmi.py - this is my attempt at the problem sheet task for Week 2. 
\nInstructions: "Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py. 
\nThe inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. 
\nThe output  is their weight divided by their height in metres squared." 
\n The biggest challenge with this problem was understanding how BMI in calculated and what conversions on the units of measurement I needed to use, but I found those answers quite easily.
\nI made a change to my first attempt in Week 03 where I limited the result to two decimal places, as per the example provided in Moodle.

2) secondstring.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 3. 
\nInstructions: "Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order." 
\nI refered to w3schools to get a better understanding of slicing strings, but had to look further afield to find a solution to this problem.

3) collatz.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 4. 
\nInstructions: "Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. 
\nAt each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. 
\nHave the program end if the current value is one". 
\nOn my first attempt, I could not figure out another way of printing the value "1" as the last output of the while loop without adding a final line of code that printed out this value. 
\nAfter watching the lectures for Week 5, I reattempted this problem using a list method and felt this worked better for this problem.

4) weekday.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 5. 
\nInstructions: "Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday". 
\nI checked w3schools for help with this problem but needed more examples.

5) squareroot.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 6. 
\nInstructions: "Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root". 
\nThis was the most challenging weekly task so far. I researched the Newton Method of estimating square roots as suggested and found the below instructions: 
\nNewtonâ€™s Method: Let N be any number, then the square root of N can be given by the formula:
\nroot N = 0.5 * (X + (N / X)) where X is any guess which can be assumed to be N or 1
\nI then had to take some time to understand the logic, and eventually found a way to solve this problem by setting some acceptable parameters around the approximation and using a while loop and if statement to check the output.

5) es.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 7. 
\nInstructions: write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. 
\nI spent quite a bit of time researching this problem before making an attempt. I first had to find out how to read a file name from the command line, and learned I needed to import the sys module to achieve this. 
\nI then tried finding the first lower case 'e' in the file I was using (an excerpt from The Hobbit) just to check that I was on the right track. 
\nOnce I had the first position, I researched how I would then find the next 'e' and count the number of results. 
\nI ended up using the char variable and using this in a for loop which increased the counter every time it found an 'e'.

ReadMe file for my GitHub contents for the Programming and Scripting module.

Contents:
1) bmi.py - this is my attempt at the problem sheet task for Week 2.
I made a change to my first attempt in Week 03 where I limited the result to two decimal places, as per the example provided in Moodle.

2) secondstring.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 3.
I refered to w3schools to get a better understanding of slicing strings, but had to look further afield to find a solution to this problem.
I found a solution on https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-index-and-slice-strings-in-python-3

3) collatz.py - this is my attempt at the weekly task for Week 4.
On my first attempt, I could not figure out another way of printing the value "1" as the last output of the while loop without adding a final line of code that printed out this value.
After watching the lectures for Week 5, I reattempted this problem using a list method and felt this worked better for this problem.
